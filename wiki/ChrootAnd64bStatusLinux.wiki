More and more linux user have a 64bits distributions. The purpose of this wiki page is to explain the situation and the possible solutions.

* It is only a DRAFT for the moment *

However Status update on following distribution are welcome : Debian / Fedora / Gentoo / Mandriva / Opensuse / Ubuntu / Slackware. Look at TODO mark.

= Introduction =
    PCSX2 does not support 64bits for various reasons.
        * The code is architecture dependent (for performance reason). Supporting both 32bits and 64bits is too much work.
        * It would need a complete rewrite of the emulator core.
        * No gain in performance, actually it could be slower.
        * ...

     The only way to use PCSX2 on an amd64 distributions is the installation of 32bits libraries.

= Chroot environment =
    The recommended way.

    === Standard library ===
    The best way to install the 32bits is to create a 32 bits chroot. Each distributions have a specific way.
      * Use Google ;)
      * Some link that could help
          # Ubuntu : http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=24575
          # TODO complete Others distribution : Debian / Fedora / Gentoo / Mandriva / Opensuse / Slackware


    === Proprietary Driver ===
      * NVIDIA
          * Do not know ^^    
      * ATI/AMD (note library paths depend on distributions)
          # Use the 32bits glxinfo to check that direct rendering is enabled
          # You need to overwrite the libGL.so.`*` libraries provided by mesa with the 32bits version in fglrx.
          # You must add the 32bits fglrx_dri.so

= IA32 libs =
    Some distributions adds the possibility to install lots of 32bits library in a big package.
       # Debian / Ubuntu: miss mutiple libraries.
          * libportaudio
          * libsoundtouch
          * libglew
          * libwxbase2.8 and libwxgtk2.8
          * nvidia-cg-toolkit
       # TODO complete Others distribution : Fedora / Gentoo / Mandriva / Opensuse /Slackware
      
= Multi arch support =
    There is a project on Debian / Ubuntu to allow the installation in the same time of any architecture package on any system. It would allow easy cross-compilation.

      * Debian / Ubuntu: not yet implemented. Would probably take at least one year :(
      * TODO complete Others distribution : Fedora / Gentoo / Mandriva / OpensUse /Slackware
