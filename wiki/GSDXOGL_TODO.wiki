== TODO ==
 # subroutine instead of define macro to compile shader.
  * only opengl 4
  * faster/slower ?
  * be easier to extend if blend/depth is merge in the fragment shader
  * subroutine limitation number to explore ?
 # Inherit multiple GSwnd (OGL_LNX/OGL_MS/DX/SDL)
 # Import index management from trunk
  * warning, there is some fog change too inside shader
  * glDrawElementsBaseVertex
 # Investigate SW shader capability (OGL4 only)
  * depth
     * pure 32 bits. 
     * Integer interpolation ???
     * speed ???
  * Manage blend from the fragment shader (OGL4)
    * test perf. Maybe mix ROP/shader
  * more GS part ???
 # wireframe drawing for debug? could be nice!

 # context attachment on the EE thread.
 # control opengl dump from gsdx.ini

== Known Issue == 
 # Half screen issue on native resolution. Nvidia bug???

== drivers issue == 
 === AMD ===
 # can't unattach shader. => Workaround, use a dummy geometry shader.
 # dual blending. For the moment, can be disabled at compilation time. Seem to be good on nvidia side.
 # crash... Would need a bigger .gs that trigger the  crash.
 === NVIDIA ===
 # fail to create an opengl 4.2 context.
