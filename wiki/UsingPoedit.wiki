#summary Using Poedit: Step-by-Step

When working with PCSX2 translations, _Poedit_ is not only recommended, but is nearly a necessity.  You will need to reference the PCSX2 source code frequently if you want to make accurate translations, and _Poedit_ is the only PO editor I could find that has such a feature built-in (and actually works as expected).

**Important!!**  Make sure that you check out the right version/revision of PCSX2 that corresponds to the PO file you've downloaded.

===Step 1: Download and Install Poedit===

http://www.poedit.net/download.php

===Step 2: Download the latest POT file provided by us.===

The latest POT file pack as generated by the PCSX2 Team can be found here: https://code.google.com/p/pcsx2/downloads/list

As of the last update to this wiki, the latest POT file pack is [http:// PCSX2_pot_0.9.7.r4120.7z].  This is a release candidiate translation POT for an eventual 0.9.8 release.  Some texts may be added or modified prior to 0.9.8 being released, however such changes should be minimal.

===Step 3: Check out PCSX2 sources===

_Make sure to check out the exact revision indicated by the POT archive!_  This is important since the source code associations listed in the POT file may not match newer revisions of PCSX2, making it difficult to resolve iconized identifiers.  The PCSX2 revision can be gleened from the comment section at the top of the POT files included in the archive.

Note that Poedit does have the ability to update the translation table to match a newer revision of PCSX2.  As a translator, you are welcome to update the translation table and get a head start on translating for an upcoming version of PCSX2.  However, translations for public/stable releases of PCSX2 should be based on the POT files provided by the PCSX2 Team.

===Step 4: Configure Poedit===

Go to *File->New Catalog from POT file...*, and select one of the POT files provided in the package you downloaded in Step 2.  You will see the following dialog:

... fill it out accordingly.  You can determine your language code using our SupportedLanguagesChart.  Supported languages are hard-coded into wxWidgets, and PCSX2 cannot support anything else at this time.  (so no Klingon... yet!)  When you click *`OK`* you will be prompted for a save location for your new .PO file.  Save it into your installed PCSX2 location, under `Langs/lang_code/`  (create the `Langs` folder if it does not already exist).  The language code for your language should be obtained from the SupportedLanguagesChart.

Make sure that the filename matches precisely the original filename in the archive (see above for a list of PO files that PCSX2 looks for).

===Step 5: Testing your translation!===

Poedit will have saved a MO file in your PCSX2 Langs folder in Step 4, and if the MO file is in the right place and has the right filename, PCSX2 will automatically detect it and offer your language as an option.  Run PCSX2 and change the current language to the one you've just created.  You may have to restart PCSX2 for the new changes to take effect in all areas of the program.
