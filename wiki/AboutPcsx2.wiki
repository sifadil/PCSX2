#summary About Pcsx2.

= PCSX2 =

PCSX2 is an open source Playstation 2 emulator. It's purpose is to mimic the the PS2 hardware, using a combination MIPS CPU [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing) Interpreters], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_recompilation Recompilers] and a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine Virtual Machine] which manages hardware states and PS2 system memory.

== Project Details ==

The PCSX2 project has been running for more than ten years. Once able to run only a few public domain demos, recent versions enable many games to work at full speed, including popular titles such as *Final Fantasy X* or *Devil May Cry 3*. Visit the *[http://pcsx2.net PCSX2 homepage]* to check the latest compatibility status of games (with more than 2000 titles tested), or ask your doubts in the *[http://forums.pcsx2.net/ Official forums]*.

The latest officially released version is *1.2.1* ( r5875 ).
Installers and binaries for both Windows and Linux are available from *[http://pcsx2.net/ PCSX2.net]*.

*Please note - All downloads from Google Code are now legacy releases as Google have removed the ability to host downloads. Please get the latest version from the link above.*

==System Requirements==
===Minimum===
    * Windows/Linux OS
    * CPU: Any that supports SSE2 (Pentium 4 and up, Athlon64 and up)
    * GPU: Any that supports Pixel Shader model 2.0, except Nvidia FX series (broken SM2.0, too slow anyway)
    * 512MB RAM (note Vista needs at least 2GB to run reliably)

===Recommended===
    * Windows Vista / Windows 7 (32bit or 64bit) with the latest DirectX
    * CPU: Intel Core 2 Duo @ 3.2ghz or better
    * GPU: 8800gt or better (for !Direct3D10 support)
    * RAM: 1GB on Linux/Windows XP, 2GB or more on Vista

*Note*: Because of copyright issues, and the complexity of trying to work around it, you need a BIOS dump extracted from a legitimately owned Playstation 2 console to use the emulator.

*Note:* PCSX2 mainly takes advantage of 2 CPU cores. As of r4865 PCSX2 can now take advantage of a 3rd core using the MTVU speedhack. This can be a significant speedup on CPUs with 3+ cores, however on GS limited games (or on dual core CPUs) it may be a slowdown.
