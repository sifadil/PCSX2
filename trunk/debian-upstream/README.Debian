-------------------------

* This version have some majors modification against default upstream
    -> documents are stored in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME instead of $HOME/pcsx2
    -> some features was removed to compile against libsound 1.3. Pcsx2 
       needs the version 1.5

* This package is highly experimental.
