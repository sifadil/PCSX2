-- Air's Notes on Using PThreads --
-----------------------------------

We use pthreads as a static link because it allows for inlined calls of several methods,
most notably the InterlockedExchange implementations.  These would be DLL invocations
otherwise, and would be roughly twice to three times the total overhead.

I created a subfolder for pthreads' publicall exposed header files, since "config.h" was
rather brutal include file namespace pollution. >_<

Important: pthread_cond is an inherently flawed concept, and is quite incredibly slow
on top of it.  It's primarily meant for inter-process thread regulation, of which we 
do none.  Therefore it has been excluded from the library builds.  Don't use it!
